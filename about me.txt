<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
I believe that long-term professional excellence is built less on talent and more on
discipline, clarity of thought, and consistency of effort.
</p>

<p>
Over the years, I have learned that most mistakes—whether in engineering, quality,
leadership, or markets—do not arise from lack of knowledge. They arise from poor
decision-making under pressure and weak process discipline.
</p>

<p>
I am Rajesh Ragiri, a professional with over seventeen years of experience across
engineering execution, quality management systems, supplier assessment, audits,
and process improvement.
</p>

<p>
This website is a reflection of my learning journey. It is written for professionals
who value depth over noise, process over shortcuts, and long-term thinking over
quick outcomes.
